# Cloud RAT ðŸŒ§

Cloud RAT is a Windows based R.A.T (Remote Administration Tool) written in the JavaScript programming language.

The Cloud RAT app uses the [electron framework](https://www.electronjs.org/), [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

# Current Features

Currently, Cloud RAT is a BETA project and is not close to being done.
The only thing that currently works is clients connecting\disconnecting from the server, and updating the UI with that information.

Please do expect bugs \ missing features in Cloud RAT in its current state.
